* [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) Used for creating  an installer for the UI (that includes the USB driver for an UNO)


# Introduction
By using an auxillary port to accept any music source, this controller is able to be a versatile setup for dancing lights to music. This published version of the firmware and accompanying UI dialog allows for the lights to be treated like a color organ or based on the beat of the music.
